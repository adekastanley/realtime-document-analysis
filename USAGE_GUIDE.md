# Document Analyzer - Usage Guide

## üöÄ Major Quality Improvements

The app now has **significantly better text extraction** with multiple approaches:

### ‚ú® New Features

#### 1. **Smart Extract** (Recommended for PDFs)
- **What it does**: First tries to extract native text from PDFs (instant & perfect quality), then falls back to OCR if needed
- **When to use**: Always try this first for PDFs
- **Speed**: Instant for text-based PDFs, slower for scanned PDFs
- **Quality**: Perfect for text-based PDFs, good for scanned ones

#### 2. **Full Page OCR** (Recommended for Images & Scanned PDFs)  
- **What it does**: Processes the entire page with enhanced image preprocessing
- **Improvements**: Grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, better Tesseract settings
- **When to use**: For images or when Smart Extract finds no text
- **Speed**: 30-60 seconds per page
- **Quality**: Much better than previous region-based approach

#### 3. **Manual Regions** (Advanced users only)
- **What it does**: Creates 3 generic regions and runs OCR on each
- **When to use**: Only if you need specific region control
- **Speed**: Slower (processes regions individually)
- **Quality**: Depends on region accuracy

## üìã Step-by-Step Usage

### For PDFs (like your resume):

1. **Upload** your PDF file
2. **Click "Smart Extract"** - this will:
   - Try to extract text directly from PDF (perfect quality, instant)
   - If no text found, automatically run full-page OCR
3. **View results** in the Results panel
4. **Ask questions** in the chat panel
5. **Export** in your preferred format (JSON/TXT/CSV)

### For Images:

1. **Upload** your image file
2. **Click "Full Page OCR"** - this will:
   - Process the entire image with enhanced preprocessing
   - Extract all visible text
3. **View results** and interact as above

## üéØ Quality Improvements Made

### Better OCR Processing:
- ‚úÖ **Image preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion + contrast enhancement
- ‚úÖ **Padding**: Adds padding around regions to capture complete words
- ‚úÖ **Better Tesseract settings**: Optimized character whitelist and page segmentation
- ‚úÖ **Full-page processing**: Avoids region boundary issues

### Smart PDF Handling:
- ‚úÖ **Native text extraction**: Uses PDF.js to extract text directly (perfect quality)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic fallback**: Only uses OCR when native text isn't available
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent region grouping**: Groups PDF text items into logical regions

### Enhanced UI:
- ‚úÖ **Better button labels**: Clear action names
- ‚úÖ **Visual feedback**: Green boxes for successful extraction
- ‚úÖ **Progress tracking**: Detailed console logging

## üîç What to Expect

### For a typical resume PDF:
- **Smart Extract**: Should extract text instantly with perfect accuracy
- **Text quality**: Exact match to original document
- **Speed**: Near-instant

### For scanned documents/images:
- **Full Page OCR**: 30-60 seconds processing time
- **Text quality**: Good accuracy with some possible OCR errors
- **Better than before**: Much more accurate than the old region-based approach

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you get "no text available":
1. Make sure you clicked the extraction button and waited for completion
2. Check browser console for progress updates
3. For PDFs, try "Full Page OCR" if "Smart Extract" fails

### If OCR quality is poor:
1. Ensure the document image is clear and high-resolution
2. Try uploading the original file instead of a screenshot
3. For PDFs, "Smart Extract" should always work better than OCR

## üéñÔ∏è Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Much better text extraction quality**
- ‚úÖ **Faster processing for text-based PDFs** 
- ‚úÖ **More accurate OCR with preprocessing**
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent PDF text extraction**
- ‚úÖ **Full offline operation**

The app should now provide **professional-grade text extraction** suitable for real document analysis workflows!
